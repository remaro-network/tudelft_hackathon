# VSCode ROS2 Workspace Template

This template will get you set up using ROS1 together with ROS2 in VSCode as your IDE.

See [how I develop with vscode and ros2](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_docker_ros2.html) for a more in-depth look on how to use this workspace.

## Features

### ROS1 bridge for ROS2
This repo is extended to include both ROS1 noetic and ROS2 foxy. The ros1/ workspace is set up to build ROS1 packages with catkin for noetic and the ros2/ workspace is set up to build ROS2 packages with colcon. 

The script [`ros2/ros1_bridge.sh`](ros2/ros1_bridge.sh) starts the dynamic ros1/2 bridge to forward messages between nodes of both ros versions. 

### Shortcuts
Some shortcuts are defined in the .bashrc file for convenience. They are listed here:  
`sf`: as in source foxy, resolves to 'source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash'  
`sn`: as in source noetic, resolves to 'source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash'  
`s`: as in source (local), resolves to 'source install/setup.bash' to source local environment in ROS2  
`m`: as in make, resolves to 'bash build.sh', requires a build script to be present in the local directory  


### Style

ROS2-approved formatters are included in the IDE.  

* **c++** uncrustify; config from `ament_uncrustify`
* **python** autopep8; vscode settings consistent with the [style guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Code-Style-Language-Versions/)

### Tasks

There are many pre-defined tasks, see [`.vscode/tasks.json`](.vscode/tasks.json) for a complete listing.  Feel free to adjust them to suit your needs.  

Take a look at [how I develop using tasks](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_tasks.html) for an idea on how I use tasks in my development.

### Debugging

This template sets up debugging for python files and gdb for cpp programs.  See [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json) for configuration details.

### Continuous Integration

The template also comes with basic continuous integration set up. See [`.github/workflows/ros.yaml`](/.github/workflows/ros.yaml).  

To remove a linter just delete it's name from this line:

```yaml
      matrix:
          linter: [cppcheck, cpplint, uncrustify, lint_cmake, xmllint, flake8, pep257]
```



### Open it in vscode

Now that you've cloned your repo onto your computer, you can open it in VSCode (File->Open Folder). 

When you open it for the first time, you should see a little popup that asks you if you would like to open it in a container.  Say yes!

If you don't see the pop-up, click on the little green square in the bottom left corner, which should bring up the container dialog

In the dialog, select "Remote Containers: Reopen in container"

VSCode will build the dockerfile inside of `.devcontainer` for you.  If you open a terminal inside VSCode (Terminal->New Terminal), you should see that your username has been changed to `ros`, and the bottom left green corner should say "Dev Container"
